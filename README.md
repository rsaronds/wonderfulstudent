Mr. Aronds lives in New Jersey surrounded by plants and animals. He believes itâ€™s impossible to have too many rescue animals as pets (although he admits things are starting to get a little out of control). For work, he spends time with technologists and other interesting people from around the world. For fun, he teaches kids to program computers, build robots, learn math, and love nature.
